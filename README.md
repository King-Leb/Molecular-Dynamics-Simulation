# Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Plasmodium PNP with Chembl Ligand (CHEMBL5434152)

## Project Overview

This project explores the interaction between a ligand obtained from the ChEMBL database and the plasmodium purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) protein, a key enzyme in the malaria parasite. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, the binding behavior and stability of the ligand-protein complex were investigated to better understand potential therapeutic mechanisms.

## Methods Summary

- **Ligand Acquisition:** The ligand structure was retrieved from ChEMBL.
- **Protein Preparation:** The plasmodium PNP protein structure was prepared for docking and simulation using MGL tools.
- **Molecular Docking:** Docking was performed to predict binding conformations.
- **Molecular Dynamics Simulation:** The docked complex underwent simulations to assess stability.
- **Analysis:** RMSD, RMSF, and interaction energies were evaluated.

## Key Results

- Stable binding confirmed by RMSD and RMSF profiles.
- Favorable interaction energies between ligand and protein.
- Visualizations demonstrate consistent binding and interaction patterns.
